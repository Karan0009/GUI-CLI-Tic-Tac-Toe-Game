# tic-tac-toe-with-python
A simple GUI based Tic-Tac-Toe game made using stock modules of python. Modules used are - turtle, random, tkinter and the code works for both python 2.x and 3.x. The game can be played between two friends and also against the system. 
Against the system has two level of hardness. Level 1 has system playing randomly and no intellect against you and level 2 has system with AI but it's currently in progress :P
Linux users will have to install tkinter on their system (not so sure about mac since I have never used one).
Kindly download tkinter manually in such scenario!

Also since I am using, tkinter module, sometimes the pop boxes don't appear in the front (i.e, it is not set as active window when the pop-box appears) and has to be clicked on to input data. Besides all this the code should be working fine!

Kindly inform me if you find any bugs!!
